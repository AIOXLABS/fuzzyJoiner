This is a very simple rule based method that compares the first and last word of people with names that share at least one word. It has an F-score of 0.471543859649 and runs in about 2 minutes on my machine on all 183,000 names. It runs in seconds on the 37,000 companies but has an F-score of only about 0.207

Here is another mechanism where we tokenize the words, put them into a set and check if one name is a subset of the other. It has a better success rate for names, with an F-schore of 0.582207840022 and a much better one for companies, with an F-Score of 0.508912602583. However, it takes much longer to run running in just under five minutes for all 183,000 names and 20 seconds for the companies.
