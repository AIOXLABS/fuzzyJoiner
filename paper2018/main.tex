\begin{abstract}
Merging datasets is a key operation for data analytics.  A frequent requirement for merging is a join between two columns that frequently have different surface forms for the same entity (e.g., the name of a person might be represented as \textit{Douglas Adams} or \textit{Douglas Noel Adams}).  Data management systems are currently limited to performing merges based on string equality, or at best use string similarity to allow so-called `fuzzy' joins.  We propose a novel approach to performing merges inspired in part by recent advances in deep learning.  Our approach depends on (a) creating a function that maps surface forms into a set of vectors such that alternate forms for the same entity are closest in vector space, (b) indexing these vectors using a space partitioning algorithm to find the forms that can be potentially joined together.  Our approach for merging datasets is efficient $\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n)$ and flexible because it can be applied to any data provided one can create a mapping function such that joinable surface forms of the entity are closer in vector space than disparate forms.  We demonstrate the generality of this approach by creating such a mapping function using deep learning models for people's names and company names drawn from Wikidata, and show that such a function does in fact produce vector embeddings that can be used together with space partitioning algorithms to perfom efficient joins.
